# Echoir
Welcome to our GitHub page!

Echoir is an open-source Discord alternative that aims to have function and yet still have form. Want to use Echoir? Go to [echoir.fr](https://echoir.fr)! **It's time to ditch Discord and go with Echoir.**
# Open source
Echoir is a fully open-source project built from scratch. Echoir is self-hostable but you can still use it without doing so.

We decided to make it self-hostable and open-source because:
- We want you to be able to **trust us** and inspect the source code that is made for Echoir.
- We want you to be able to contribute code to us and help us become better.
- We want you to be able to develop plugins for Echoir and make cool community projects out of it.
